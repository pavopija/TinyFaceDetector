The idea of this Thesis project is to design and implement an accurate face detection model from scratch, while exploring the underlying mathematical theory of machine learning. The proposed model aims to detect human faces in diverse environments - regardless of the number of faces present in that image, their occlusion, pose variations, or illumination conditions. A key step in developing such a robust system is the choice of a training dataset that offers sufficient diversity and realism. To that aid, we employ the WIDER FACE dataset
